# Hackfestival
This GitHub organization was created by a team that participated in [Hackfestival](https://hackfestival.de/) 2024, a hackathon focused on developing innovative solutions for "Decarbonizing the Planet." Our team collaborated to explore and prototype ideas that address sustainability challenges through technology.

## About Us
We are a small team that came together at Hackfestival 2024 to bring our concept to life. The event combined tech, design, and business to create impactful solutions aimed at reducing CO2 emissions.

## 2024 Project: Local Farmers' Platform
Our idea was to create a platform that connects local farmers with customers looking for locally sourced products. The platform allows users to find, order, and later receive delivery of products from local farmers.

### Components
- **Mobile App (Flutter)**: Currently under development.
- **Web App**: A functional demo showcasing the platform's capabilities.
- **Backend**: A working prototype that supports the web app.

## Repositories
- **mobile**: Mobile application prototype in Flutter.
- **backend**: Backend service developed in Python.
- **.github**: Configuration and documentation for our team.

## Get Involved
We encourage contributions, feedback, and participation
